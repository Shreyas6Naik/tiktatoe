# tiktatoe
Description:
This Python code is a simple implementation of a two-player tic-tac-toe game. It allows two players to take turns and play the classic game on a 3x3 board until one of them wins, it's a draw.

Features:
Players can take turns to make their moves.
The code checks for a win by looking at rows, columns, and diagonals.
It also checks for a draw (when all cells are filled).

Usage:
Clone or download the repository containing the code.

Open the Python script in your favorite code editor or IDE.

Run the script to start the game.

Follow the on-screen instructions to make your moves:

When it's "X's chance," you can enter a number from 0 to 8 to place an "X" on the board.
When it's "O's chance," you can enter a number from 0 to 8 to place an "O" on the board.
The game continues until one player wins, it's a draw, or you decide to quit.

The script will announce the winner or declare a draw and display the final board.

To restart the game, run the script again.

Note:
This code provides a basic implementation of the game and is meant for two human players. It doesn't include features like a computer opponent or saving game history. Feel free to enhance it and add more features as needed.
